# Maintainers

This file lists current maintainers and expected responsibilities.

## Current maintainers

- Joseph Verdicchio — project lead

## Responsibilities

- Review and merge pull requests
- Triage issues and discussions
- Enforce the code of conduct
- Coordinate security response and disclosures
- Maintain release and citation metadata

## Decision policy

For routine changes, maintainer consensus on PR review is sufficient.
For protocol-impacting or compatibility-sensitive changes, maintainers should
request additional review and include explicit compatibility notes.
