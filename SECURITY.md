# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report security issues in public GitHub issues.

Instead, report potential vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers listed in
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md) with the subject line: `DiscOS security report`.

Include:

- Affected component(s) and version(s)
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
- Potential impact
- Any proposed mitigations

We will acknowledge reports promptly and work with you on coordinated disclosure.

## Scope

This policy covers the DiscOS repository contents and release artifacts.

## Disclosure process

1. Triage and validate the report.
2. Identify impacted versions and remediation plan.
3. Prepare and test a fix.
4. Coordinate disclosure timing with reporter when feasible.
5. Publish advisory and patched release notes.
