# LangChain / LangGraph EvidenceOS Tool Wrapper (Smoke)

This adapter wraps DiscOS/EvidenceOS verification calls as a tool function for LangChain-style runtimes.

## Safe scope
- Calls EvidenceOS health and ETL verification paths.
- No operational attack playbooks.

## Smoke test
```bash
./integrations/langchain-wrapper/smoke_test.sh
